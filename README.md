# Locations-CleanArchitecture

Project based in [*clean-architecture*](https://github.com/antoniolg/clean-architecture) project from Antonio Leiva, following [*this post*](https://devexperto.com/clean-architecture-android/).

I used MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with [*LiveData*](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and [*ViewModel*](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) instead of MVP in the presentation layer.
